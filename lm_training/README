In addition to OpenFst and Pynini, this also depends on:

OpenGrm ngram: http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/NGramLibrary
OpenGrm Thrax: http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Thrax

In each of the subdirectories

gk
pan
pie
pb
skt

there is a script

make_roots_lm.sh

that will build a LM from the initial list of roots, and then generate a million
root TOKENS, which are then uniqued with their counts.

Run the script in the directory.

These lists of phonotactically reasonable roots are used in the main simulation
code already distributed.
