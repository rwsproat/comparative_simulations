This version corresponds to the code that was used for the results reported in the paper. Any 
updates will be made to a cloned version, location TBD.

The code and data in this directory starts with the randomly generated roots for
each language (see data/random_roots_*.tsv) and the "Swadesh" lists (see
data/swadesh_*_*.tsv) and estimates the probability of finding the number of
matches in the Swadesh list, given two languages that have the phonotactics
exhibited in the random roots.

See scripts/generate_random_cognate_lists.sh for how to run this.

This depends on having installed:

1) OpenFst: http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/FST/WebHome

   Be sure to configure with the --enable_grm option

2) Pynini: http://www.openfst.org/twiki/bin/view/GRM/Pynini


Note that the previous phase --- generating the random lists of roots from
actual data, requires additional installations.
